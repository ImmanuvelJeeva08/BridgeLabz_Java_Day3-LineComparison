# BridgeLabz_Java_Day3-LineComparison_

Use Case1 -> Using Cartesian System, To calculate the length of the Line by using below Formuale
A length as 2 points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2)
Length of a Line = sqrt( (x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 )

Use Case2 -> To check the equality of two Lines that are equal or not

Use Case3 -> To compare two lines based on end points, So that I know one line is equal, greater or less than the other line
